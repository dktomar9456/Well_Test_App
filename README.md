# well_Test_modal
A Model created to predict some reservoir parameters like skin factor , permeability and Radius Of investigation from welltest data interpretion.
this Deep learning Model is created by Keras and Tensorflow Libraries.
It Automaticaly reads Data from csv file. and calculate the result.
this modal was tested on the some test data with known parameters.And it is showing more more than 98% accuracy when compared to actual values.
modal can be further tested on google colaboratery.
